# BP's Level Generator
A command line-bassed PvZ 2 level generator tool, made with small help from Bing AI for level logic and some fixes by me. Open source!

Crediting me (BP) is optional, but it will be appreciated if you do.
I wrote this program with some help from Bing AI for basic logic, and I did some fixes to make sure it
fit with the official PvZ 2 level format.

# ⚠Warning⚠
### Some generated levels by this tool are impossible to beat, so make sure you regenerate it or decrease the RNG in config.ini file!

### Ignore Windows Defender warning because this caused by the unsigned program, but it's safe cuz I'm do some debugging in my main device before publishing this tool and doing some tests to make sure everything was working well. And add this program to Windows Defender's exclude list, because for no reason all unsigned program including programs generated by Visual Studio is marked as malware too.

# OS Support
Windows 7 or newer including Windows 11, *Recommended to use Windows Terminal for Windows 10 and newer*

# Usage
Just run the exe and follow the step.
And you must enter some zombie typenames from ZombieTypes to `zombienames.txt`, I've been giving the example file it ends with `_example.txt`. Same thing if you want to add plants to the conveyor in Special Delivery levels in `conveyorplants.txt`.
And you can customize the zombie RNG count for each waves via `config.ini`, this also applies to Plant Food in waves.
